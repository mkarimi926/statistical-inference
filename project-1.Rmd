## Overview

This is an R Markdown document for the statistical inference class. I will use simulation to explore inference and do some simple inferential data analysis. Then, I will be investigating the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem.

My project consists of two parts:

1. A simulation exercise, where I will be generating an exponential distribution at a rate of lambda == 0.2 where lambda is the rate parameter. We will do thousand such simulations.

2. Perform basic inferential data analysis from the simulated data.

### Simulation Exercise
Step 1: Generate an exponential distribution for 40 exponentials with a rate of 'lambda' = 0.2 (we assumed lambda == 0.2). 

```{r, tidy=TRUE}
# Ensure that the random numbers are always the same by setting the seed
set.seed(3890) 
numberOfSimulations <- 1000
numberOfExponentials <- 40
lambda <- 0.2
```

Using the above values, generate 1000 sets of simulations and store them in a dataframe.

```{r, tidy=TRUE}
simulationSetDF <- data.frame(mean=(numberOfSimulations))
for(simulationIndex in 1:numberOfSimulations){
  thisSimulationSet <- rexp(numberOfExponentials, lambda)
  simulationSetDF[simulationIndex, 1]<-mean(thisSimulationSet)
}
# Sample contents
head(simulationSetDF)
```


### Inferential Data Analysis
I will be investigating the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials and in the process with explain and illustrate the following:

#### Analysis 1: Derive the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.

##### Sample Mean
Sample Mean is the value obtained by dividing the sum of a set of quantities by the number of quantities in the set. Also called average, Sample Mean is an unbiased estimator for the population mean.

```{r}
sampleMean <- mean(simulationSetDF$mean)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
sampleMean
```

##### Theoretical Mean
Theoretical Mean is the mean of the exponential distribution and is calculated as 1/lambda.
```{r}
theoreticalMean <- 1/lambda
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
theoreticalMean
```

We now plot both sample and theoretical means on the histogram below:

```{r}
# plot histogram
hist(simulationSetDF$mean, probability = TRUE, main = "Distribution of Simulated and Theoretical Means", xlab = "Mean of 40 Exponentials")

# plot the density curve
lines(density(simulationSetDF$mean), col="red", lwd=5)

# plot theoretical mean
abline(v=theoreticalMean, col="yellow", lwd=5)

# capture first 100 means between the range of simulationSet 
sequenceOfMeans <- seq(min(simulationSetDF$mean), max(simulationSetDF$mean), length=100)

# capture the density
densities <- dnorm(sequenceOfMeans, mean=theoreticalMean, sd=theoreticalMean/sqrt(numberOfExponentials))

# plot theoretical density curve
lines(sequenceOfMeans,densities, col="blue", lwd=5)

# add legend
legend('topright',c('Simulated Density Curve','Theoretical Density Curve','Theoretical Mean'),cex=0.8,col=c('red','blue','yellow'),lty=1,lwd=5)
```


##### Inference
From the above histogram, we can clearly infer that the sample mean value is very close to theoretical mean.

#### Analysis 2: How variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.

Calculate Theoretical Variance
```{r}
# theoretical variance
theoreticalVariance <- ((1/lambda)^2) / numberOfExponentials
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
theoreticalVariance
```

Calculate Sample Variance
```{r}
# sample variance
sampleVariance <- var(simulationSetDF$mean)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
sampleVariance
```

##### Inference
We observe that the sample variance and theoretical variances are very close.

#### Analysis 3: Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
```{r echo=FALSE}
# plot histogram
hist(simulationSetDF$mean, probability = TRUE, main = "Distribution of Simulated and Theoretical Means", xlab = "Mean of 40 Exponentials")

# plot the density curve
lines(density(simulationSetDF$mean), col="red", lwd=5)

# plot theoretical mean
abline(v=theoreticalMean, col="yellow", lwd=5)

# capture first 100 means between the range of simulationSet 
sequenceOfMeans <- seq(min(simulationSetDF$mean), max(simulationSetDF$mean), length=100)

# capture the density
densities <- dnorm(sequenceOfMeans, mean=theoreticalMean, sd=theoreticalMean/sqrt(numberOfExponentials))

# plot theoretical density curve
lines(sequenceOfMeans,densities, col="blue", lwd=5)

# add legend
legend('topright',c('Simulated Density Curve','Theoretical Density Curve','Theoretical Mean'),cex=0.8,col=c('red','blue','yellow'),lty=1,lwd=5)

```

##### Inference
From the above plot, we observe that both sample and theoretical distributions are approximately normal
