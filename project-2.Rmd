## Overview

This is an R Markdown document for the second project in the statistical inference class, in which, I will be analyzing the ToothGrow data in the R data sets package. My project consists of the following:

1. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses 
2. Provide a basic summary of the data.
3. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose, by using the techniques from class.
4. State my conclusions and the assumptions needed for my conclusions. 

### About `ToothGrowth` dataset
`ToothGrowth` dataset is the length of odontoblasts (teeth) in each of 10 guinea pigs at each of three dose levels of Vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg) with each of two delivery methods (orange juice or ascorbic acid). 

The format is a data frame with 60 observations on 3 variables:

1. [,1] `len` 	numeric 	Tooth length
2. [,2] `supp` 	factor 	Supplement type (VC or OJ).
3. [,3] `dose` 	numeric 	Dose in milligrams. 

Now, let's load the `ToothGrowth` data
```{r}
toothGrowthDF <- data.table(ToothGrowth)
head(toothGrowthDF)
```


### Basic Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Review the internal structure of the `ToothGrowth` dataset:
```{r}
str(toothGrowthDF)
```

The numeric variable `dose` is an experimental factor with three discrete levels (0.5, 1 and 2 milligrams), so we will convert it to a factor variable.
```{r}
ToothGrowth$dose <- factor(ToothGrowth$dose)
table(ToothGrowth$dose)
```

#### Review the summary of `ToothGrowth` dataset:
```{r}
summary(toothGrowthDF)
```


#### Frequency table to verify the number of observations

```{r}
toothGrowthFreqTable <- table( ToothGrowth$supp, ToothGrowth$dose)
toothGrowthFreqTable
```

#### Plot length of teeth v/s supplement (VC or OJ)
```{r}
 plot( len ~ supp, data=ToothGrowth)
```

#### Plot length of teeth v/s dosage
```{r}
 plot( len ~ dose, data=ToothGrowth)
```

From the above two plots we notice that as the dosage increases then length of the tooth increases. However we are unable to determine which of the two supplements (VC or OJ), is contributing to the growth of the teeth. 

### Confidence Interval and Null Hypothesis Tests

In the subsequent steps we will use `Confidence Interval and Null Hypothesis Tests` to compare tooth growth by supplement and dosage.

#### Comparative Analysis of Dosages

##### Null Hypothesis: `Increasing the dosages of VC or OJ, DOES NOT increase the length of the teeth`

Let's begin by creating three vectors of data, one for each dosage level (0.5mg, 1mg and 2mg)
```{r}
subset0.5mg <- subset(toothGrowthDF,dose=='0.5')$len
subset1.0mg <- subset(toothGrowthDF,dose=='1')$len
subset2.0mg <- subset(toothGrowthDF,dose=='2')$len
```

Working towards our null hypothesis we will start comparing dosage in their increasing order by using t-tests to see if there are differences between the two dosage groups.

##### Case 1: Increase the dosage from 0.5mg to 1.0mg:

Performing t-tests:
```{r}
tTest0.5mgTo1.0mg <- t.test(subset0.5mg, subset1.0mg, paired=FALSE,var.equal=FALSE)
```

Get the 95% `confidence interval` for the mean appropriate to the specified alternative hypothesis.
```{r}
tTest0.5mgTo1.0mg$conf.int[1:2]
```

When we increase the dosage from 0.5mg to 1.0mg, we found that the confidence intervals do not contain zero (0)

##### Case 2: Increase the dosage from 1.0mg to 2.0mg:

Performing t-tests:
```{r}
tTest1.0mgTo2.0mg <- t.test(subset1.0mg, subset2.0mg, paired=FALSE,var.equal=FALSE)
```

Get the confidence interval for the mean appropriate to the specified alternative hypothesis.
```{r}
tTest1.0mgTo2.0mg$conf.int[1:2]
```

When we increase the dosage from 1.0mg to 2.0mg, we found that the confidence intervals do not contain zero (0)

##### Conclusion from Case 1 and Case 2: 
In both the cases, confidence intervals do not contain zero (0) we can reject the null hypothesis to conclude that `Increasing the dose DOES increase the length of the teeth`

#### Comparative Analysis of Supplements

##### Null Hypothesis: `Increasing vitamin C supplements alone, DOES NOT increase the length of the teeth`

Let's being by creating two vectors of data, one for VC and other for OJ:

```{r}
subsetVC <- subset(toothGrowthDF,supp=='OJ')$len
subsetOJ <- subset(toothGrowthDF,supp=='VC')$len
```

##### Compare the two supplements:

Performing t-tests:
```{r}
tTestSupplements <- t.test(subsetVC, subsetOJ, paired=FALSE,var.equal=FALSE)
```

Get the p-value and confidence interval for the mean appropriate to the specified alternative hypothesis.
```{r}
tTestSupplements$p.value
tTestSupplements$conf.int[1:2]
```
 
##### Conclusion
We observe that p-value os 0.60 and the confidence interval contains 0 and therefore we `DO NOT REJECT` the null hypothesis and conclude that `Increasing vitamin C supplements alone, DOES NOT increase the length of the teeth`.

#### Comparative Analysis of two supplements with each of the three dosages:

##### Null Hypothesis: `Supplements with 0.5mg dosage of vitamin C DOES NOT affect tooth growth`
Let's being by creating two vectors of data, one for VC and other for OJ for 0.5mg dosage:

```{r}
subsetVC0.5mg <- subset(toothGrowthDF,supp=='VC' & dose == '0.5')$len
subsetOJ0.5mg <- subset(toothGrowthDF,supp=='OJ' & dose == '0.5')$len
```

##### Compare the two supplements with 0.5mg dosage:

Performing t-tests:
```{r}
tTestSupplements0.5mg <- t.test(subsetVC0.5mg, subsetOJ0.5mg, paired=FALSE,var.equal=FALSE)
```

Get the p-value and confidence interval for the mean appropriate to the specified alternative hypothesis.
```{r}
tTestSupplements0.5mg$p.value
tTestSupplements0.5mg$conf.int[1:2]
```
 
##### Conclusion
We observe that the confidence interval does not contains 0 and therefore we `REJECT` the null hypothesis.

##### Null Hypothesis: `Supplements with 1.0mg dosage of vitamin C DOES NOT affect tooth growth`
Let's being by creating two vectors of data, one for VC and other for OJ for 1.0mg dosage:

```{r}
subsetVC1.0mg <- subset(toothGrowthDF,supp=='VC' & dose == '1')$len
subsetOJ1.0mg <- subset(toothGrowthDF,supp=='OJ' & dose == '1')$len
```

##### Compare the two supplements with 1.0mg dosage:

Performing t-tests:
```{r}
tTestSupplements1.0mg <- t.test(subsetVC1.0mg, subsetOJ1.0mg, paired=FALSE,var.equal=FALSE)
```

Get the p-value and confidence interval for the mean appropriate to the specified alternative hypothesis.
```{r}
tTestSupplements1.0mg$p.value
tTestSupplements1.0mg$conf.int[1:2]
```
 
##### Conclusion
We observe that the confidence interval does not contains 0 and therefore we `REJECT` the null hypothesis.

##### Null Hypothesis: `Supplements with 2.0mg dosage of vitamin C DOES NOT affect tooth growth`
Let's being by creating two vectors of data, one for VC and other for OJ for 2.0mg dosage:

```{r}
subsetVC2.0mg <- subset(toothGrowthDF,supp=='VC' & dose == '2')$len
subsetOJ2.0mg <- subset(toothGrowthDF,supp=='OJ' & dose == '2')$len
```

##### Compare the two supplements with 2.0mg dosage:

Performing t-tests:
```{r}
tTestSupplements2.0mg <- t.test(subsetVC2.0mg, subsetOJ2.0mg, paired=FALSE,var.equal=FALSE)
```

Get the p-value and confidence interval for the mean appropriate to the specified alternative hypothesis.
```{r}
tTestSupplements2.0mg$p.value
tTestSupplements2.0mg$conf.int[1:2]
```
 
##### Conclusion
We observe that p-value is close to 1 and the confidence interval DOES have 0 and therefore we `ACCEPT` the null hypothesis and conclude that `vitamin C dosage of 2.0mg does not affect tooth growth. However, we cannot conclude which of the two supplements types has a greater impact.

### Final Conclusions
1. Increasing dosages of Vitamin C alone affects tooth growth.
2. Increasing Vitamin C supplement alone does not affect tooth growth. 
3. With 0.5mg or 1.0mg intake of Orange Juice (OJ) supplement increases tooth growth than Ascorbic Acid (VC).
4. With 2.0mg intake intake of Orange Juice (OJ) or Ascorbic Acid (VC) supplements there is no impact on the tooth growth and we cannot conclude which of these two supplements has a greater affect of tooth growth.
 
### Assumptions
1. We are working with Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) samples.
2. Confidence intervals are not paired and therefore we don't want a paired test.
3. The variances are not equal and therefore we are not using pooled variances to estimate the variance, instead the Welch (or Satterthwaite) approximation ot the degrees of freedom is used.
